# Max's OpenCV Final Project
This is Max's final project for Computer Vision (Acc.).

# Goal:
1. Make an **overlay system** to lay bruin heads (+ possibly other things) on tracked human faces.
2. Find foreground + background, **replace background** with a forest (+ possibly other pictures) to keep the bruin theme.
